# Data science project: Car price and age 

**Author:** Enkhsaikhan Usny-Ekh  


## Description

This mini project explores the relationship between car price and age for used cars in Chicago and Los Angeles. This analysis finds a negative association: the price is lower, on average, by 11.3% for every additional year of age. 

## Data Source

The data are taken from the case study in the textbook *Data Analysis for Business, Economics and Policy by Gabor Bekes and Gabor Kezdi.* Data contains information (e.g., price, age, fuel type, etc.) about Toyoto Camry cars in Chicago and Los Angeles. 

## Folder Structure

- `data/` – Raw datasets  
- `code/` – Python scripts  
- `output/` = Graphs and tables made through the analysis     
- `README.md` – Project documentation  


## Python environment requirements

This project uses Python 3.10+ and requires several data analysis libraries. 

The following packages are required to run the analysis
- **numpy** - numerical computations
- **pandas** - data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** - plotting and visualization
- **seaborn** - plotting and visualization
- **statmodels** - regression analysis
- **scipy** - scientific computing library

Example installation:
```python
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn scipy
```
