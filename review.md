#### Reproducibilty Report
The code was reproducible. I did not have to change any lines of code for it to run.

#### Overall Opinion
Overall, the project was done well. It is reproducible and pretty readable. The documentation and analysis is clear. And the project is organized very nicely. The one aspect that could be more descriptive are the commit messages. The current commit messages do not provide much insight into the development process of the project.

#### Suggested Improvements
- More specific commit messages to know more about what changes were made for each commit
- Creating a virtual evironment could be a nice expansion to the reproducibility of the project, especially since the code is dependent on a number of packages
